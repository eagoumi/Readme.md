#### ðŸ”­ Current Projects

**Ft_IRC**
- **Description**: Ft_IRC is a project where I developed an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server from scratch. This project involved deep dives into network programming, protocol management, and real-time multi-user communication. The server is capable of handling multiple chat rooms, direct messaging, and robust user connections, built using C++. The main challenges were ensuring stability, efficient data handling, and concurrency, providing a thorough understanding of how real-time communication technologies work under the hood.

**Inception**
- **Description**: Inception is focused on containerization and orchestration, utilizing Docker and Docker-compose. The goal is to deploy a small web application in a setup mimicking a real production environment. This project includes multiple containers with separate rolesâ€”web server, application, and databaseâ€”each configured with specific requirements and security in mind. The challenge lies in managing inter-container communication and maintaining data persistence while ensuring minimal downtime and high availability.

**Ft_transcendence**
- **Description**: This project involves building a full-stack application with a live chat and gaming feature, where users can play pong against each other in real-time. Built using TypeScript, Node.js, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL, Ft_transcendence challenges traditional web application boundaries by integrating WebSockets for real-time interactions and advanced frontend and backend integrations. The main hurdles were optimizing real-time data exchange, user authentication, and creating a seamless, engaging user experience.
